# Capstone

In this project I am going to compare the abilities of Super Heroes from different publishing houses. I am using the term "Heroes" but this does include both Heroes and Villians.

This will allow the user to select their particular super heroes and then allow them to see how they match up against each other.

The concept is to allow the user to select from a drop-down list the publishers they want to search through, then once they have selected 2 heroes, it will show a graph of their powers and abilities.

(Pie in the sky) - Link to an image found online to show the picture of the hero.

I would also like to see a comparision of Male vs Female superheroes. My idea will have a simple pie chart with the percentage of Male vs Female heroes.

I would also like to show how many Male vs Female Superheroes are deceased. I have been wondering if the publishers kill off female heroes.

While cleaning the data, I did notice that the Marvel Dataset includes ALL Characters that have appeared in the comic books, so I am limiting the selection to actual heroes or villians and not civilian nor animals that have appeared in the comic books.

I would also like to try and use BeautifulSoap to webscrape data from the web to make sure I have the latest data for my comparison.
